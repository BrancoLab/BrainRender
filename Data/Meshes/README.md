# Metadata
These files include metadata about the meshes used for rendering brain structures of the Mouse, Rat and Drosophila brains. These metadata files are derived from resources that are provided together with the original datasets (see below) and reported here for convenience. They simply specify to what brain region each file corresponds so that it can be loaded correctly based on what regions the user wants to display.


# Data
## Mouse
The mesh data (.obj files) collected [here](Meshes/mouse_meshes) are downloaded from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas reference frame
through the Allen API services. 

Allen Brain Atlas [reference atlas](http://atlas.brain-map.org)
and [connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org) using the Allen [API](http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/Allen%2BBrain%2BAtlas%2BAPI)
(Â© 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Brain Atlas API. Available from: [brain-map.org/api/index.html](brain-map.org/api/index.html)) 
([1], [2]).


## Rat
The .stl data collected in the "rat meshes" folder is from the [in browser 3D rat brain viewer](https://github.com/tfiers/3D-rat-brain)
from [Tfiers](https://github.com/tfiers).
For more details of how the data was generated, read [here](https://github.com/tfiers/3D-rat-brain/blob/master/data/README.md).

## Drosophila
The .obj data collected in the "drosophila meshes" folder is from the [Virtual Fly Brain Project](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain)'s adult brain [template](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/DrosAdultBRAINdomains) based on work from [Jennet et al 2012](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(12)00292-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124712002926%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).
